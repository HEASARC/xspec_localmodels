C     The program computes the black-body emission spectrum from a thin 
C     Keplerian accretion disk around a Kerr black hole. All relativistic 
C     effects are taken into account, including frame-dragging, Doppler boost, 
C     gravitational redshift, and bending of light by the gravity of the black 
C     hole. In particular, self-irradiation of the disk as a result of light 
C     deflection is included. The inner boundary of the disk is fixed at the 
C     marginally stable orbit. Torque at the inner boundary of the disk 
C     is allowed to be nonzero. However, when this program is applied to data
C     reduction, a zero torque (eta = 0) is recommended since we have found
C     that the effect of a nonzero torque on the spectrum can, to a good 
C     approximation, be absorbed into a zero torque model by adjusting the
C     mass accretion rate and the normalization.
C
C     The program reads in the precalculated data file kerrbb.fits and 
C     uses it to fit spectral data by linear interpolation. The first
C     extension (GRIDVALS) contains 4 rows specifying:
C     - a grid of black hole spin (a/M);
C     - a grid of disk inclination angles (in degrees);
C     - a grid of the torque at the inner boundary of the disk (eta, dimensionless);
C     - a grid of spectrum energy (in keV)
C     The second extension (FLUX) contains the flux density at each grid 
C     point specified by the above four parameters, in photons/keV/cm^2/sec.
C     [There are four columns in this file: FLUX1, when both self-irradiation 
C     and limb-darkening are turned off; FLUX2, when self-irradiation is off 
C     but limb-darkening is on; FLUX3, when self-irradiation is on but 
C     limb-darkening is off; FLUX4, when both self-irradiation and 
C     limb-darkening are on.]
C
C     The program requires the following input arguments
C     - "EAR(0:NE)": array of observed energy (frequency) bins (in units of 
C        keV);
C     - "NE": number of observed energy bins (size of the energy array);
C     - "eta" : ratio of the disk power produced by a
C         torque at the disk inner boundary to the disk power arising 
C         from accretion. It must be >= 0 and <=1. When eta = 0, the 
C         solution corresponds to that of a standard Keplerian disk with 
C         zero torque at the inner boundary;
C     - "astar" : specific angular momentum of the black hole in 
C        units of the black hole mass M (geometrized units G=c=1). a 
C         should be >= -1 and < 1;
C     - "theta" : disk's inclination angle (the angle between the 
C        axis of the disk and the line of sight). It is expressed in 
C         degrees. i=0 is for a "face-on" accretion disk. i should be <=  
C         85 degree;
C     - "Mbh" : the mass of the black hole in units of the solar mass;
C     - "Mdd" : the "effective" mass accretion rate of the disk 
C        in units of 10^18 g/sec. When eta = 0 (zero torque at the inner 
C        boundary), this is just the mass accretion rate of the disk. When 
C         eta is nonzero, the effective mass accretion rate = (1+eta) times 
C         the true mass accretion rate of the disk. The total disk 
C         luminosity is then "epsilon" times "the effective mass accretion 
C         rate" times "c^2", where epsilon is the radiation efficiency of a 
C         standard accretion disk around the Kerr black hole;
C     - "Dbh" : the distance from the observer to the black 
C         hole in units of kpc;
C     - "fcol" : spectral hardening factor, T_col/T_eff. It should
C         be greater than 1.0, and considered to be 1.5-1.9 for accretion 
C         disks around a stellar-mass black hole. See, e.g., Shimura and 
C         Takahara 1995, ApJ, 445, 780;
C     - "rflag" : a flag to switch on/off the effect of 
C         self-irradiation (never allowed to be free). Self-irradiation is 
C         included when rflag is > 0. Self-irradiation is not included when 
C         rflag is <= 0;
C     - "lflag" : a flag to switch on/off the effect of limb-
C         darkening (never allowed to be free). The disk emission is assumed 
C         to be limb-darkened when lflag is > 0. The disk emission is assumed 
C         to be isotropic when lflag is <= 0.
C     - "ZBH": the redshift of the source. This is only used to modify the
C         variable ca (change by Jack Steiner). The redshift will presumably
C         be appropriate for the distance DBH input
C
C
C     The program outputs an array of the observed photon flux in each bin 
C     of energy: "PHOTAR(NE)", in units of photons/cm^2/second. For
C     example, PHOTAR(i) gives the observed photon number flux with 
C     observed photon energy between EAR(i) and EAR(i+1).
