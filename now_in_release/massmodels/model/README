cycle.pl does the clean up, recompile cycle for the local model,
adding GSL to the final link.  Any argument causes it to do the full
build cycle.  Otherwise, it just does the hmake and link fix.

Model no longer requires the same number of spectra in every data
group.

Fixed a serious bug with the handling of data groups that are not in
outward radial order.

Fixed a non-bug by restoring the use of size_t in place of int's.

Allow beta model parameters to be fitted.

The gravitational potentials are abstracted into derived classes in
the files Potential.cxx and Potential.h, making it relatively easy
to add new models for the potential.
