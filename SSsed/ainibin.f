c		rashafer 1 april 1987
c	subroutine to initialize the variable used by EREBIN to rebin
c	arrays, assuming that the samples are flat topped histograms
c	from the lower limit to the  upper limit of the bin (e.g. photon
c	arrays)

c Arguments :
c     nin     i                 I: number of unbinned energy ranges
c     ein     r                 I: The unbinned boundaries
c     nout    i                 I: The number of binned ranges
c     eout    r                 I: The binned boundaries
c     start   i                 R: The first unbinned point
c     end     i                 R: The last unbinned point (if <=start(i)
c                                    then there is only one point used)
c     fstart  r                 R: The weighting for the first(or only) point
c     fend    r                 R: The weighting for the last point.  If
c                                  end(i)>start(i)+1, then all points between
c                                  have a weighting of 1.
c     z       r                 I: Redshift:  The input model is redshifted
c                                  by the factor Z, i.e. all input energies
c                                  are treated as coming from ranges

c  N.B.  In the current implementation, all the output bins
c        that have any part below the first input bin are set to
c        zero flux.  However, if a bin is partially above the
c        last input bin, then it is allowed a partial accumulation
c        (It just was easier to do that one at the time).
