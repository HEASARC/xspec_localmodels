# absmodels

These local models are analogs of the gaussian absorption multiplicative model (gabs) but for Lorentzian (lorabs) and Voigt (voigtabs) line shapes. The line shape parameters are defined the same way as the corresponding additive line models. The line depth parameter, d, is defined so that the model M(E) = exp(-d * A(E)), where A(E) is the normalized Lorentzian or Voigt line.

## Installing the models

These local models can be installed in according to the <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xspec/manual/XSappendixLocal.html">"Adding Models to XSPEC" Appendix</a> in the manual.

These models are expected to be in the standard Xspec release starting with version 12.14.2.
